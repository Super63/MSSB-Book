# MSSB-Book
# Emulates the book/box score shown at the end of a MSSB game
# - This code blows but it works ! -
# Will always output a box score (PC box score, mobile box score, or both depending on user input)
# PC Box score is exact same as MSSB box score, EXCEPT it correctly shows extra innings (instead of the 10th replacing the 1st and so on)
# PC Box score WILL BREAK if 10+ runs are scored in a inning (skill issue)
# Mobile Box score will output just the users, inning amount, runs, and hits, no innings - to be compatible with phones
# Book will output the exact same stats as the MSSB book, for both teams
# Inputs are 0/1/2 (0 = PC Box, 1 = Mobile Box, 2 = Both)
# Along with 0/1 (0 = No book, 1 = book)
